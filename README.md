All-in-one Battleye, Bec, DayZ Automatic Restart With Message.

DISCLAIMER
I want to say that i did not make the original version of this script.
The original version can be found [here](https://forums.dayz.com/topic/239892-install-battleye-server-startbat-server-restarts-server-crash-restarter/)  Which was Made by mrwolv and that i have full permission to release my modified and updated version here.

As you can see from the photo the DayzSa Server Status cmd box will keep a check on your server if it

crashes and it will auto restart!! This will also reboot your server on the timed restarts & as you can see BEC

is also running on the back cmd box. All you need to do is Run 1 .bat File

 

(Also If You Find Your Server wont Show In The Server List Just Open Ports 2302-2307, 27016  TCP/UDP On Your Router & Firewall Of Your Pc/Server. If You Have Problems With The Right I.P For Your Server Just Open CMD Type ipconfig & Look For Your IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : Thats The I.P You Need To Set In The Files)
