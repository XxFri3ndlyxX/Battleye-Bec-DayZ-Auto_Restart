# Battleye-Bec-DayZ-Auto_Restart
All-in-one Battleye, Bec, DayZ Automatic Restart With Message.

DISCLAIMER
I want to say that i did not make the original version of this script.
The original version can be found [here](https://forums.dayz.com/topic/239892-install-battleye-server-startbat-server-restarts-server-crash-restarter/)  Which was Made by mrwolv and that i have full permission to release my modified and updated version here.

Q&A
Q: What modification did you make?
A: I update Bec to the latest version.
I had to redo the complete scheduler.xml so it would work correctly as it had some changes made to how scheduler works.
I also added 15, 10 minutes server restart warnings.
I made small edit to the server.bat file and added description as to what do what.
That's it, i hope you enjoy this DayZ script as much as i do.

This script will do the following:
```
-Starts Dayz Server
-Restart Your Server Automaticaly If It Crashes
-Run Battleye On Your Server
-Runs a 3 Hour Restart Timer For Your Server
-Runs Server Messages Of Your Choice
-Include Guide To Install Its Very Simple To Do
-Also Includes Whitelist, BadWords, BadNames, Ban Files (Admin.Xml Not usefull Yet)
```

As you can see from the photo the DayzSa Server Status cmd box will keep a check on your server if it
crashes and it will auto restart!! 
This will also reboot your server on the timed restarts & as you can see BEC is also running on the back cmd box. 
All you need to do is Run 1 .bat File

 

(Also If You Find Your Server wont Show In The Server List Just Open Ports 2302-2307, 27016  TCP/UDP On Your Router & Firewall Of Your Pc/Server. 
If You Have Problems With The Right I.P For Your Server Just Open CMD Type ipconfig & Look For Your IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : Thats The I.P You Need To Set In The Files)
